        <p>
          I am a Fullstack Web Developer with a B.B.A. in Marketing from Texas
          Tech University, with experience in Sales, Marketing, and Management.
          I am looking to develop projects, on both the front and back-end for
          various utilities. Including, but not limited to: UI/UX Design,
          Blockchain Development and Software Development. I am 22 years old
          currently living in St. Louis, MO, with previous experience in the
          Business/Marketing/Management Industries, as well as MERN Stack Development. My overall goal is to build
          apps, websites and programs that can truly make a difference. Scroll
          down for some of my recent projects and my contact info!
